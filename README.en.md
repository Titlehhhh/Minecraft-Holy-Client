# Download

Follow the [link](https://github.com/Titlehhhh/Minecraft-DDOS-Free/releases/tag/Main) and download setup.exe . This is the ClickOnce installer, which will install and, if necessary, delete the application. You can learn more about ClickOnce [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment?view=vs-2022).

Note! Starting from version 1.0.0.13, some components have changed in the application due to which there will be no auto-update, so you will need to update manually. To do this, download the new installer from the link above and run it. He will do all the "dirty" work himself. 


# Problems

If you have any problems with the installation or operation of the software, then immediately create an Issuse.
